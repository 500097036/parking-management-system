## Introduction

### Purpose of the Project

The Parking System project aims to provide a simple and efficient solution for managing parking lots in urban areas. It facilitates the process of parking, retrieval, and viewing information about parked vehicles.

### Problem Statement

In urban areas, finding suitable parking spaces can be time-consuming and frustrating. The Parking System addresses this issue by offering a streamlined and automated solution for parking management.

### Target Beneficiary

The target beneficiaries include drivers in urban areas struggling to find parking spaces and parking lot managers looking for an organized and automated system.

### Project Scope

The project scope covers the development of a console-based application, allowing users to park, retrieve, and view information about parked vehicles.

## Project Description

### Data / Data Structures

The project utilizes a structured array-based data structure to manage parking spots. Each spot is represented by a structure containing information such as vehicle number, spot availability, and a unique token.

### SWOT Analysis

- **Strengths:** Simple and easy-to-use interface, efficient parking spot management.
- **Weaknesses:** Limited to console-based interaction, fixed parking lot capacity.
- **Opportunities:** Potential for future GUI implementation, integration with external databases.
- **Threats:** Competition from more sophisticated parking management systems.

### Project Features

- Parking and retrieving cars.
- Displaying a list of parked vehicles.
- Token-based system for retrieval.

### Design and Implementation Constraints

The project is constrained by its console-based nature and the fixed capacity of the parking lot (up to 10 vehicles).


## System Requirements

### User Interface

The system primarily relies on a console-based user interface for user interactions.

### Protocols

No specific protocols are utilized in the current implementation.

## Non-functional Requirements

### Purpose of Project

The primary purpose is to provide a user-friendly and efficient solution for parking lot management.

### Usability

The system should be easy to use, requiring minimal input for parking and retrieval.

### Reliability

The system must accurately track parking spot availability and ensure the correct association of tokens with vehicles.
